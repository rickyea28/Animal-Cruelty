    <img class="top-img" src="animalrights.jpg" alt="a sign">

    <p> According to <a href="https://thehumaneleague.org/article/animal-rights"> The Humane League </a> animal rights is "that non-human animals should be free to live as they wish, without being used, exploited, or otherwise interfered with by humans". Many animal rights advocates want to distinguish animals from inanimate objects because they are exploited so often. Animal rights basically aim to do something similar to human rights but just for animals. Very few countries have added animal rights as a law.</p>
